\chapter{Abstract}

The DTUSat-2 project is a student satellite project at DTU. Any software being run on the satellite could potentially make the satellite unresponsive if a serious error occured. Therefore, a failsafe mode has been developed which should catch theses failures so that the DTUSat-2 staff can investigate errors and prevent them from happening again by uploading new software.
To operate the failsafe mode the staff needs both a console tool and a graphical user interface. It is the purpose of this project to investigate possible solutions and produce the software necesarry for the staff to be able to operate the satellite when in failsafe mode.
