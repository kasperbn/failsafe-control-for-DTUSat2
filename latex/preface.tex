\chapter{Preface}

This Bachelor thesis was accomplished at the Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling (IMM), at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), during the period 1st of February 2010 to the 30th of June 2010. The project was supervised by Associate Professor Hans Henrik Løvengreen of the IMM department at DTU.

This thesis documents the Failsafe Control for DTUSat-2 software. It is aimed at the DTUSat-2 staff and should give any staff member a thorough overview of the requirements, design decisions, implementation specifics, test results, installation instructions and operating instructions of the software produced.

I would like to thank Hans Henrik Løvengreen for his advice, guidance and enthusiasm throughout the project. Also a big thanks to my friends and my family for their support and advice.
