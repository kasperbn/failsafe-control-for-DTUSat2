\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at Informatics Mathematical Modelling,
the Technical University of Denmark in fulfillment of the
requirements for acquiring the Bachelor degree in engineering.

This bachelor thesis documents the Failsafe Control for DTUSat-2 software. It is aimed at the DTUSat-2 staff and should give any staff member a thorough overview of the requirements, design decisions, implementation specifics, test results, installation instructions and operating instructions of the software produced.
A big thanks should go out to my supervisor Hans Henrik Løvengreen who has been very helpful with all aspects of the project.
